# AlphaShore Local

The local system that helps acheive a local p2p connection with two web pages without needing a backend. This is the standard WebRTC QR setup, able to run within itself and without relying on anything external or from the internet. 
This is not a final version, in fact, this project is only on its very early stages of development.

In the future, we expect to implement End-To-End encryption and packet compression, even using Array buffers to transfer complex data in pure binary. As a cherry on top, this would be configured to be incoorperated in some other projects of adthoughtsglobal as an key component.
